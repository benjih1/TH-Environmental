								<p id="warning"><strong>***Unfortunately due to current project commitments the pond health check service will not be available until early 2021***</strong></p>
								<p>A graduate in Zoological Sciences, I have spent the last 17 years working within the water industry where I have gained a plethora of experience in this field. Specialising as a microbiologist, I worked for seven years in a UKAS accredited water quality laboratory. Here I developed skills in; accurate lab techniques, aseptic techniques and microscopy.</p>
								<p>Working for eight years as a senior process scientist within the Process Technology team, I developed skills in safe and accurate catchment sampling. This included multi source, biological, chemical, wastewater, drinking water and catchment sampling. Furthermore, developing best practice methodology for bacterial sampling in river catchments provided a wealth of experience. It was a pleasure to be involved in cutting edge innovative projects- including the use of green technologies to meet regulatory requirements.</p>
								<p>Recently, the last two years have afforded me the opportunity to work as the Catchment Technical Specialist for the Integrated Catchment team. Here, I helped to drive forward technical aspects based on clients’ goals and ambitions to improve the river catchments within a geographical area. I worked closely with many stakeholders including; local authorities, Rivers Trusts, environmental groups and farming communities. Developing and instigating catchment projects such as; nutrient balancing models, green solutions and partnerships were projects that afforded me the opportunity to gain significant experience.</p>
								<p>At present, I’m on a short-term contract with Natural England as a Lead Advisor for water quality where I have improved my knowledge and skills in: catchment sensitive farming; farming rules for water, and protected sites.</p>
